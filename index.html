        <h1>RailVault</h1>
        <p align="left">This website explores the concept of repurposing old coal carriages to house sustainable zinc bromide batteries, 
            creating decentralized energy storage hubs. These hubs can store renewable energy, stabilize grids, 
            and provide backup power for trains and nearby communities.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Does This Idea Exist?</h2>
        <p>My name is Jamison Young, and I’ve been restoring an old railway station in the Czech Republic as part of a personal and community-driven project. Recently, a set of old coal carriages was parked in front of my station. This sparked an idea: could these unused carriages be repurposed to house sustainable energy storage solutions, such as zinc bromide batteries?</p>
    
        <p>The concept is simple yet innovative. Zinc bromide batteries are a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries, offering several advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heat Resistance:</strong> Zinc bromide batteries perform well in high temperatures, reducing risks associated with overheating.</li>
            <li><strong>Recyclability:</strong> They are easier and less polluting to recycle compared to lithium-ion batteries.</li>
            <li><strong>Weight Compatibility:</strong> Their heavy nature makes coal carriages a practical housing solution, as these carriages are designed to carry significant loads.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>This idea leverages existing infrastructure. Old railway tracks and stations, often underutilized, could serve as renewable energy hubs. By parking battery-equipped carriages on these tracks, we can create a decentralized energy storage network with multiple applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Renewable Energy Storage:</strong> Collecting solar, wind, or other renewable energy during the day and storing it for nighttime use.</li>
            <li><strong>Grid Stabilization:</strong> Balancing grid demands and providing energy overflow storage, especially for nuclear power plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Train Power Supply:</strong> Stabilizing power for electric trains, ensuring reliable operation even during surges in energy demand.</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Power Backup:</strong> Serving as a critical energy reserve for railway stations and nearby towns during emergencies.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>This concept draws inspiration from advancements in zinc bromide battery technology. For example, researchers at Sydney University have developed a zinc bromide gel battery, and companies like Gelion in the UK are working to commercialize and refine this technology.</p>
