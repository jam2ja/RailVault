    <meta name="description" content="This concept proposes repurposing unused coal carriages to house sustainable zinc bromide batteries, offering several advantages: heat resistance, recyclability, and weight compatibility. By utilizing old railway tracks and stations as energy hubs, these battery-equipped carriages can store renewable energy, stabilize grids, power electric trains, and provide emergency backup. This innovative approach leverages existing infrastructure to create a decentralized energy storage network, inspired by advancements in zinc bromide battery technology, such as developments by Sydney University and Gelion.">
