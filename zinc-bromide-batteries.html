    <h1>Learn More About Zinc Bromide Batteries</h1>
    <p>Zinc bromide batteries are rechargeable flow batteries that use zinc and bromine chemistry to store and release energy. 
      Known for their high temperature tolerance, recyclability, and deep discharge capabilities, 
      they are emerging as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage applications.</p>
