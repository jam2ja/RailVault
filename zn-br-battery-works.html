    <h1>How a Zinc Bromide Battery Works</h1>
    <p>
        Imagine a battery as a <strong>rechargeable tank of energy</strong>. A zinc bromide battery is like a system with 
        <strong>two tanks of liquid</strong> connected to a machine that stores and releases energy when needed.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <h3>The Tanks</h3>
    <p>
        There are two tanks of liquid. Let’s call them "Tank A" and "Tank B." These tanks hold a special salty water mix 
        that’s really good at carrying energy.
    </p>

    <h3>The Energy Machine</h3>
    <p>
        In between the tanks, there’s a part we’ll call the "energy machine." This is where the magic happens—it takes 
        energy in and sends energy out.
    </p>

    <h3>Charging (Storing Energy)</h3>
    <p>
        When you <strong>charge the battery</strong> (like plugging it into solar panels or the grid):
        <ul>
            <li>Tank A gets filled with "zinc coins" (pretend these are made of energy).</li>
            <li>Tank B gets filled with a different kind of "energy juice" (bromine).</li>
        </ul>
        So now, Tank A has stored energy (the zinc coins), and Tank B has its part ready too.
    </p>

    <h3>Discharging (Using Energy)</h3>
    <p>
        When you <strong>need energy</strong> (like turning on a light):
        <ul>
            <li>The machine takes the "zinc coins" from Tank A and combines them with the juice from Tank B to release electricity.</li>
            <li>As this happens, the zinc coins dissolve back into the salty water, ready to be charged again.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Why It’s Cool</h2>
    <p>
        Zinc bromide batteries are:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Refillable:</strong> You can keep storing and using energy over and over.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalable:</strong> Need more energy? Just make the tanks bigger!</li>
            <li><strong>Eco-Friendly:</strong> Great for renewable energy storage like wind and solar.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Real-Life Use</h2>
    <p>
        Imagine you have solar panels on your house. During the day, the sun charges the battery (fills Tank A with zinc coins). 
        At night, when the sun is gone, the battery gives you electricity to keep your lights on. It’s like having a reusable 
        energy piggy bank!
