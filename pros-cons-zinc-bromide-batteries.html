    <h1>Pros and Cons of Zinc-Bromine Batteries vs. Lithium-Ion Batteries</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Both zinc-bromine and lithium-ion batteries are pivotal energy storage technologies with unique advantages and limitations. This page explores their pros and cons, market dynamics, ecological impacts, and recycling processes, providing a comprehensive comparison.
    </p>

    <h2>Market Dynamics and Ecological Impacts</h2>
    <p>
        The dominance of lithium-ion batteries in the energy storage market is largely due to established industries and massive investments in manufacturing infrastructure. These industries have created extensive supply chains and are motivated to maintain their monopoly, making it difficult for alternative technologies, such as zinc-bromine batteries, to gain traction.
    </p>
    <p>
        This monopoly comes at a significant ecological cost. Lithium-ion batteries rely on raw materials such as lithium and cobalt, the extraction of which is associated with severe environmental and social consequences, including habitat destruction, water pollution, and labor exploitation in resource-rich regions. 
        (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/1/38" target="_blank">MDPI</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
        By contrast, zinc-bromine batteries use materials that are more abundant and less damaging to extract, offering a safer and more sustainable alternative. However, the entrenched market power of lithium-ion battery manufacturers often sidelines these innovations, delaying the transition to greener technologies.
    </p>

    <h2>Zinc-Bromine Batteries</h2>
    <h3>Pros</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cons</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Lower Energy Density:</strong> They store less energy per unit weight, making them unsuitable for portable applications. 
            (<a href="https://www.solarkobo.com/post/zinc-bromine-flow-batteries" target="_blank">SolarKobo</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Maintenance Needs:</strong> Regular upkeep is required to prevent dendrite formation and manage bromine vapors.

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Size and Weight:</strong> These batteries are bulky and heavy, which can limit their use in compact systems.
